                <p>Dog food is food specifically formulated and intended for consumption by dogs and other related canines. Dogs are considered to be omnivores with a carnivorous bias. They have the sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for the consumption of meat than of vegetable substances, yet also have ten genes that are responsible for starch and glucose digestion, as well as the ability to produce amylase, an enzyme that functions to break down carbohydrates into simple sugars – something that obligate carnivores like cats lack. Dogs evolved the ability living alongside humans in agricultural societies, as they managed on scrap leftovers and excrement from humans.</p>

                <p>Treats are the key means in training your four-legged fellow to listen to commands and to behave nicely. When training dogs, it is essential to reward them for obedience and effort. An incentivising bite will give your pet positive emotions and also helps to learn commands more quickly. Choose those treats that are specially designed for training and that are easy to dos</p>

                            <p>A dog toy is a toy that is specifically for dogs to play with. Dog toys come in many varieties, including dog bones, puppy toys, balls, tug toys, training aids, squeaky toys, discs and frisbees, plush toys, and sticks.
                            Dog toys serve different purposes. Puppies, for instance, need toys they can chew on when they are teething because their gums and jaws become very sore and chewing on things provides them relief. Playing with different toys also encourages exercise, which benefits the dogs' overall health, stimulates their minds, discourages problem behavior resulting from boredom and excess energy, and promotes dental health.</p>
