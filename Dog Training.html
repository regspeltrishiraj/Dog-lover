        <p>Dog training is the application of behavior analysis which uses the environmental events of antecedents (trigger for a behavior) and consequences to modify the dog behavior, either for it to assist in specific activities or undertake particular tasks, or for it to participate effectively in contemporary domestic life. While training dogs for specific roles dates back to Roman times at least, the training of dogs to be compatible household pets developed with suburbanization in the 1950s.</p>
        <p>Dog training usually involves the basic obedience training to establish control over the animal and can then progress to more advanced specialist training. Basic obedience training includes teaching a dog.</p>
        <li>Recall – teaching the dog to come on command</li>
        <li>Sit – teaching the dog to sit on command</li>
        <li>Heeling – teaching the dog to walk on or off lead with the handler</li>
        <li>Stay – teaching the dog not to stray on command</li>
        <li>Socialising – teaching the dog not to be aggressive to humans, other dogs or other animals</li><br><br><br>
