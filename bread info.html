                <p>The American Bully is a dog breed that originated from the United States as a newly designed breed using a foundation of the American Pitbull Terriers and American Staffordshire Terriers and some Bulldog-type breeds.
                    It’s a medium-sized dog at about 16 to 20 inches tall, weighing between 30 to 65 pounds.</p>

                <p>The Belgian Malinois excels not only in herding, but also in protection and law enforcement; drug, bomb,
                     and gas detection; search and rescue; tracking; obedience; sledding; agility; and therapy assistance 
                     to disabled, ill or elderly people. This dog is demanding and needs an experienced owner. A wide range is
                      seen in temperament and aggressiveness. They want nothing more than to be with their family, which makes
                     them unsuitable as a kennel dog.</p>

                <p>The Bulldog originated in England with the practice of bull baiting, in which a dog was set upon a bull to 
                torment it before it was killed. This was done as entertainment and to make the bull's meat more tender. 
                The ordeal might last for hours, during which the dog was expected to grab the bull, often by its muzzle, 
                and hang on. Having jaws that protruded beyond the dog's muzzle helped it breathe while hanging there.</p>

                <p>According to the breed standard of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, the Cane Corso 
                was once distributed throughout much of the Italian peninsula, but in the recent past was
                found only in Puglia, in southern Italy.After the collapse of the mezzadria system of 
                share-cropping in the 1960s, the dogs became rare. The modern breed derives from selective 
                breeding from about 1980 of a few surviving animals. A breed society, the Società Amatori 
                Cane Corso, was formed in 1983.</p>

                    <p>The Chow Chow is a spitz-type of dog breed originally from northern China.
                     The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull 
                     and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for 
                     a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough. 
                     The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff
                      or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, 
                      or cream</p>

                  <p>The German Shepherd[a] or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of medium to 
                    large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional
                     German herding dogs from 1899.
                     It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used 
                     in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, 
                     police work, and warfare.</p>

                            The Indian Spitz was one of the most popular dogs in India in the 1980s 
                            and 1990s when India's import rules made it difficult to import dogs of 
                            other breeds.</p>

                                <p>The Tibetan Terrier is a medium-sized breed of dog that originated
                                  in Tibet.[1] Despite its name, it is not a member of the terrier group.
                                  The breed was given its English name by European travelers due to its
                                   resemblance to known terrier breeds.[2] The Tibetan name for the breed, 
                                   Tsang Apso, roughly translates to "shaggy or bearded ("apso") dog, from 
                                   the province of Tsang". Some old travelers' accounts refer to the dog 
                                   as Dokhi Apso or "outdoor" Apso, indicating a shaggy or bearded 
                                   working dog which lives outdoors.</p>
